# 📊 IBM Capstone Project: Data Analytics with Power BI

This project is part of the **IBM Data Analytics Capstone**, where I analyzed **technology trends**, **future preferences**, and **demographic patterns** using a dataset of **18,821 global respondents**. While the original design was meant for **Google Looker Studio**, I rebuilt it using **Power BI** to gain deeper insights and build dynamic, visually rich dashboards.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project investigates how people interact with technologies like:

- **Programming languages**
- **Databases**
- **Cloud platforms**
- **Web frameworks**

It also dives into:

- **Age distribution**
- **Geographic representation**
- **Educational backgrounds**

By analyzing these aspects, the project uncovers both current usage and future preferences in tech.
